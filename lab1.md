In the image above, the first line is using the **cd** command with *no arguments*.
This changes the directory to the curretn directory.

In the second line, I used **cd** with *a directory* called 'lecture1' as the argument.
This changes the directory to the directory that was typed in the argument.

In the third line, I used **cd** with *a file* called 'Hello.java' as the argument.
This produces an error which is seen in the forth line. This shows that **cd** should only be used for directories.

## Command: *ls*

In the image above, the first line is using the **ls** command with *no arguments*.
This shows the contents of the current directory in a list, as seen in line 2.

In the third line, I used **ls** with *a directory* called 'messages' as the argument.
This prints the contents of the directory in the argument, as seen in line 4.

In the fifth line, I used **ls** with *a file* called 'en-us.txt' as an argument.
This produces an error as you cannot **ls** a file, as seen in line 6.

In the second image, I used **cat** with *a directory* named
